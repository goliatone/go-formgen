# Runtime Assets

Files in this directory are distributable browser bundles intended to be served by Go apps via `formgen.RuntimeAssetsFS()`.

They are generated from the runtime package under `client/` (see `client/package.json`) and then copied into this directory for inclusion in the Go module.

Do not edit the minified files manually.
